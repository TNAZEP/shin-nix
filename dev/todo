General Desctiption of structure:
Nix config that is modular and uses home manager for certain application configurations but keeps user experience as easy as possible


Folder structure:
- dev: development files, primarily descriptions of project structure
- hosts: nixos configuration files and home manager files for each host, each host has a configuration.nix and a home.nix, contains system specific configuration. Currently midgar is setup for my NixOS desktop, ishgard is my macbook air using nixos-darwin
- modules: nixos modules to be easily loaded for any specific systems needs
- modules/apps: packages that are configured with home manager, to be easily imported by other modules
- modules/common: common configuration to be loaded by all systems
- modules/hardware: modules for things required by specific hardware, for instance graphics drivers
- modules/roles: configurations for specific roles, for instance a desktop role for desktop use, a gaming role for hosts that will be used for gaming etc
